\section{Data}
The data I chose was 2018 MLB hitting data from ESPN. Originally, I wanted to try and pull from Baseball Savant but the website doesn't appear to be very friendly for scraping data. I then moved on to Baseball Reference but was met with similar problems. Finally I found that ESPN had similar stats but was much easier to scrape.I am going to use hitting stats in my thesis so this is a step in the right direction. The guides I used were the one from class as well as one I found online that was more specific to ESPN.   (https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/marschall/SLG_scraping.html#1)

When it came to using an API to gather data, I initially had some success in finding a free sports API at SportsRadar. They had a trial for their API's in sports ranging from cricket to football. I found a key for Global Baseball but quickly realized that I didn't know what package to use in R for this API. I ended up finding an API with a guide on MySportsFeed and was able to start trying to use it, until it was going to charge me for access to any of their sites. I was able to get up to the authentication of the key before it wouldn't accept the key. I guess I will need to go back and figure out better resources for sports data using API keys.

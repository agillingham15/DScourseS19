\section{Introduction}
As you will probably be able to see from the R script, I got completely lost during question 6. Because of that I didn't know how to do 7-9. However, I did want to still turn in a table and be able to practice that because it will be useful for the project. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Optimal Values}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
\hline\hline
Model & Optimal Value & Out of Sample \\ [0.5ex]
\hline
Tree Model & 0 & 0  \\
Logistic Reg & 0 & 0    \\
Neural Network & 0 & 0  \\
Naive Bayes & 0 & 0 \\
kNN & 0 & 0 \\
SVM & 0 & 0 \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:Optimal}
\end{table}
